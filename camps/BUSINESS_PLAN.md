# PDX Camps Business Plan & Marketing Playbook

## Executive Summary

PDX Camps is a summer camp discovery and planning platform for Portland-area families. Unlike competitors who serve camp operators (Sawyer, CampDoc, ActivityHero), PDX Camps is **parent-first**: we aggregate camp data from 100+ providers and help families plan their entire summer week-by-week.

**Key differentiators:**
- Week-by-week coverage planning (not just search)
- Aggregated data from all providers (OMSI, Portland Parks, Oregon Zoo, etc.)
- Family-centric: track multiple children, see gaps, fill them
- Free for parents (camp operators pay nothing—we scrape public data)

**Target market:** Portland Metro Area families with children ages 5-14
- ~55,000 households with school-age children
- Median household income: $78,000
- High demand, fragmented supply

### Timing: When Parents Search

| Period | Parent Activity |
|--------|----------------|
| **December-January** | Research begins, early registration opens |
| **February** | Active research, comparing options |
| **March** | Peak booking month—camps fill up |
| **April** | Secondary booking wave, filling gaps |
| **May** | Last-minute scramble, waitlists |

**Critical insight:** We need to capture attention by **January** and have content ranking by **December** for the following summer.

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct competitors (camp directories):**
- PDX Parent Camp Guide - Editorial, not searchable
- Portland Summer Camps - Basic listings, no planning tools
- Kids Out and About - National, less local depth
- Sawyer Browse - Discovery for Sawyer customers only

**Indirect competitors (camp management platforms):**
- [Sawyer](https://www.hisawyer.com) - Modern booking, parent-friendly
- [ActivityHero](https://business.activityhero.com) - Marketplace model
- [CampDoc](https://www.campdoc.com) - Health/safety focus

**Our advantage:** We're the only platform focused on **planning across providers**. Parents don't want to visit 15 different websites—they want one view of their summer.
