# BOOTSTRAP PLAN: $500 Budget, Cash Flow Positive

## The Math

$500 in paid ads at $5 CPA = 100 users
100 users at 5% conversion = 5 paying customers
5 customers × $29 = $145

**That's a loss.** Paid ads don't work at this budget.

## New Strategy: Sell First, Scale With Revenue

We need to charge enough per customer that we're profitable on day one, then reinvest revenue into growth.

---

## WHAT PARENTS WILL PAY FOR RIGHT NOW

Parents are stressed. Camps are filling up. They'll pay for:

| Pain Point | Willingness to Pay |
|------------|-------------------|
| "I don't have time to research" | HIGH |
| "I'm afraid I'll miss registration" | HIGH |
| "I don't know what's good" | MEDIUM |
| "I can't compare prices easily" | LOW |

**Key insight:** The tool saves time, but some parents will pay MORE for someone to just do it for them.

## WEEK 1: FREE MARKETING (NO ADS)

### TASK: Facebook group launch post
**This is your "launch" - make it count**

Post to Portland Moms (19K members) and other groups:

```
"Hey Portland parents! 👋

I'm a local dad who got tired of checking 20 different websites to plan
summer camps. So I built something.

PDX Camps shows ALL Portland camps in one place—OMSI, Oregon Zoo,
Portland Parks, Trackers, and 100+ more. You can plan your whole
summer week-by-week and see what's still available.

It's free to browse and search. There's a paid version ($39) if you
want the full planner with deadline alerts.

And if you're totally overwhelmed, I'm doing "Camp Concierge" calls
where I'll literally plan your whole summer with you in 30 minutes.
A few parents have done it and said it was a lifesaver.

Would love feedback from Portland parents—what would make this more
useful for you?

pdxcamps.com"
```

**Why this works:**
- Introduces free tool (value first)
- Mentions paid options naturally
- Asks for feedback (engagement)
- Personal story (authentic)

### TASK: Post the deadline spreadsheet
**Same as before, but with soft pitch:**

```
"Made a spreadsheet of Portland camp registration deadlines—sharing
in case it helps!

[Google Sheet link]

Also built pdxcamps.com to see all camps in one place. Free to browse,
$39 if you want the full planner. Happy to answer questions!"
```

### TASK: Direct outreach to stressed parents
**When you see posts like:**
- "Help! I haven't planned camps yet!"
- "What camps still have space??"
- "I'm so overwhelmed with summer planning"

**Response:**
```
"I feel you! I built pdxcamps.com exactly for this—shows what's still
available across all Portland camps. Free to browse.

If you're really overwhelmed, I also do 30-min planning calls where
I'll help you map out your whole summer. A few parents have said it
saved them hours. DM me if interested!"
```

### TASK: Reach out to 10 friends/acquaintances with kids
**Personal outreach converts better than ads**

Text/email:
```
"Hey! Quick favor—I built a summer camp planning tool for Portland
parents and I'm looking for early feedback.

Would you be willing to try it and tell me what sucks?
It's at pdxcamps.com

Also offering a "Camp Concierge" thing where I hop on a call and
help plan your whole summer. Would that be useful to you?
First few are discounted while I'm testing it out."
```

## THE MINDSET

You're not building a startup with VC money. You're building a **business**.

- Every dollar spent must return more dollars
- Talk to customers constantly
- Charge more than you think you can
- Revenue is the only metric that matters right now

**February goal:** $3,000 revenue, 0 external funding needed.

**March goal:** Use February revenue to run real ads. Scale.
