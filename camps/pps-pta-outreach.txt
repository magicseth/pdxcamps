Hi there!

I'm a PPS parent (5 kids across the district) and I built PDX Camps — a free tool that helps families find summer camps, compare schedules, and coordinate with friends. You can check it out at pdxcamps.com.

I was planning to set up a fundraising partnership with Atkinson's PTA, but realized this could work for every PPS PTA. Here's how it works: your PTA shares a referral link, families sign up free, and when they upgrade to Premium your PTA earns 20% — no cost, no effort, recurring revenue.

Details here: https://pdxcamps.com/partners

Happy to chat if you'd like to learn more!
