## The $200 Plan (v2): "Get Into the Room"

### Who we're reaching

Moms, 30-45, dual-income suburban families spending $200-600/week on camps. They're organized but overwhelmed. They plan in February. They trust:
1. Other moms they know (school pickup, class parent chains)
2. Their neighborhood (Nextdoor)
3. Local mom accounts they follow on Instagram
4. Facebook groups they're already in
5. PTA newsletters and school email blasts

They do NOT trust: Reddit posts, ads, random DMs, Fiverr spam.

### The insight

One PTA email blast to 200 families is worth more than 1,000 Reddit impressions. One trusted local mom sharing your tool in her class parent text chain reaches 30 high-intent parents. The $200 should buy access to rooms you're not in.

### 1. PTA / School Newsletter Sponsorship — $75

**Why:** PTAs send weekly emails to hundreds of families. February is when they include camp planning resources. A small sponsorship gets you in.

**How:**
- Contact 5 elementary schools near you in Portland (your home market)
- Email the PTA president or newsletter coordinator
- Offer $15/school for a mention in their next newsletter

**Email to send:**
> Hi! I'm a Portland parent who built a free summer camp planner (pdxcamps.com). It helps families see all local camps in one place and plan week by week. Would your PTA be open to a small mention in the next newsletter? I'd be happy to make a $15 donation to the PTA as a thank you. It's completely free for families — no cost to them at all.

- 5 schools x $15 PTA donation = **$75**
- Reach: 200-400 families per school = 1,000-2,000 high-intent parents
- These are parents who are ACTIVELY thinking about camp right now
- PTA endorsement = instant trust

### 2. Two Real Local Mom Influencers — $75

**Why:** Not $10 story posts. Two real partnerships with moms who have 3K-10K followers and post about Portland/Seattle family life. Pay them fairly ($35-40 each) for a real post (not just a story).

**Accounts to DM (start with top 5, close 2):**

| Handle | Followers | Market | Why |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----|
| @fulltimelivingblog | ~4.3K | Portland | Family lifestyle, outdoor adventures, right in sweet spot |
| @kid.friendly.pdx (Katrina) | ~26K | Portland | Kid-friendly PDX recommendations — above range but perfect fit, may negotiate |
| @momwhatsnextpdx (Olivia) | ~22K | Portland | Community page feel — "empowering families to explore together" |
| @thegoandgrowfamily (Shavonne) | ~5.7K | Seattle | Family adventures, ParentMap featured, perfect follower range |
| @thriftynwmom (Jen & Sia) | ~9.4K | Seattle | Budget-friendly family activities, NW travel, top of range |
| @pnw_wanderings (Carol) | ~10K | Seattle | Kid-friendly Seattle activities, authentic mom content |
| @two.n.tow (Tonya) | ~3-8K | Seattle area | Journalist + mom, places to go with kids |
| @micah.juliet | ~15K | Portland | Mom of 3, outdoor family content — slightly above range |

**Priority DMs:** @fulltimelivingblog (Portland, perfect size), @thegoandgrowfamily (Seattle, perfect size), @thriftynwmom (Seattle, budget-family niche), @kid.friendly.pdx (Portland, topically perfect even if larger)

**DM to send:**
> Hey [name]! I'm a local parent who built a free summer camp planner for [Portland/Seattle] families. It helps parents browse all the local camps, plan week by week, and share with their co-parent.
>
> I'd love to partner with you on a post (feed or reel, not just a story). I can pay $40 and you'd have complete creative control — I just want your honest take after trying it. Would you be open to it?
>
> Site: [pdxcamps.com / seacamps.com]

- 2 influencers x ~$37.50 = **$75**
- A real feed post lives forever (stories disappear in 24 hrs)
- DM 8-10 accounts to close 2
- One Portland, one Seattle (your two branded domains)

### 3. Nextdoor Neighborhood Blitz — $30

**Why:** Nextdoor IS this demographic. Suburban moms checking neighborhood updates. Highest trust social platform. Neighbors recommending things to neighbors.

**How:**
- Post organically in your neighborhood (free)
- Boost/promote the post for $30 targeting families within 15 miles
- If Nextdoor doesn't offer promotion, post in 5+ nearby neighborhood groups manually and use the $30 on a second boost later

**Post:**
> Camp planning season is here! I built pdxcamps.com — a free tool that shows all Portland summer camps in one place. You can plan week-by-week for each kid, compare prices, and share your plan with your co-parent. Saves hours vs. the spreadsheet method. Totally free.

- **$30** boost
- Nextdoor users in this demo click and convert at 3-5x the rate of other platforms

### 4. Coffee + Printouts for School Pickup — $20

**Why:** This sounds old-school but it's the highest-trust channel that exists. You hand a flyer to another parent at school pickup and say "I built this, try it." That parent tells 3 friends.

**How:**
- Design a simple half-page flyer (or just use a notes app and print it):
  - "Free summer camp planner for Portland families"
  - "pdxcamps.com"
  - "Browse all local camps | Plan week by week | Share with co-parent"
  - QR code pointing to pdxcamps.com
- Print 100 copies at FedEx/Staples ($15)
- Buy a box of coffee from Starbucks ($5 traveler — this is optional but buys you goodwill)
- Hand them out at your kids' school pickup or post them on the school community board
- Ask the front office if you can leave a stack in the lobby

- Printing = **$15**, coffee = **$5** → **$20**
- 100 flyers in the hands of parents at one school = 20-40 signups
- These are the most qualified leads possible — parents at your kids' school

### Total: $200

| # | Item | Cost | Expected Signups | Why It Works |
|---|------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1 | PTA newsletter sponsorship (5 schools) | $75 | 40-100 | Trusted channel, parents already reading about camps |
| 2 | Two real local mom influencers (feed posts) | $75 | 30-60 | Authentic, permanent posts, real engagement |
| 3 | Nextdoor boost | $30 | 15-30 | Exact demographic, neighborhood trust |
| 4 | School pickup flyers + coffee | $20 | 20-40 | Highest trust, face-to-face, word of mouth |
| | **TOTAL** | **$200** | **105-230** | |

### Why This Is Better Than v1

- **No spam.** No Fiverr VAs, no $10 DMs, no Reddit coin tricks.
- **Every dollar buys trust.** PTA endorsement > Facebook giveaway. A real influencer post > 5 cheap stories. A flyer from another parent > a Reddit post from a stranger.
- **Compounds through word of mouth.** PTA parents tell other parents. The influencer post lives forever in their feed. The school flyer goes home in backpacks. Nextdoor comments create neighborhood buzz.
- **Matches the demographic.** These are moms who spend $400/week on camps. They don't browse Reddit. They read PTA emails, scroll Nextdoor, follow local mom accounts, and talk at pickup.
