## PHASE 1: Reddit Posts (Do This First — 30 min)

Post these in order, spacing them 15–20 minutes apart to avoid spam filters. Use your personal Reddit account. **Do NOT post from a brand-new account** — Reddit will shadowban you.

### 1. Portland — r/Portland, r/askportland
**Title:** I made a free tool to plan Portland summer camps after spending 20+ hours in spreadsheets last year

Last summer I lost my mind trying to coordinate camps for two kids across 9 weeks. Different age ranges, conflicting schedules, some camps only ran certain weeks, and I had notes scattered across tabs, emails, and sticky notes.

So I built pdxcamps.com to solve this exact problem. It's completely free to use. You can browse hundreds of local camp sessions (OMSI, THPRD, Mount Hood Kiwanis, all the usual suspects), see week-by-week coverage for June through August, and actually spot the gaps before it's too late.

The planner view shows you which weeks each kid is covered and which ones are still empty. You can compare prices, filter by age/location, save favorites, and share your plan with your co-parent so you're not texting screenshots back and forth.

I'm covering my costs with an optional premium tier, but the core tool is free forever. If you're in the Portland area and dealing with summer camp planning, check it out: pdxcamps.com

Happy to answer questions. And if your favorite camp isn't listed, you can request it and I'll add it.

### 2. Seattle — r/Seattle, r/SeattleWA
**Title:** Free Seattle summer camp planner — finally found something better than my chaos spreadsheet

Every year I tell myself I'll get organized early for summer camps. Every year I'm scrambling in April with 47 browser tabs open trying to figure out which weeks we still need coverage.

This year I found seacamps.com and it's been a game changer. It's a free tool that lets you see all your kids' summer weeks in one view — June through August — and shows exactly which weeks you still need to fill.

You can browse camps from all over the area (think Seattle Parks, Bellevue, Sammamish, Eastside locations), filter by age range and price, and save the ones that work. The map view is great for finding something close to home or work.

The best part is sharing your plan with your partner. No more "did you register for that week?" texts. You can both see the full calendar and know what's covered.

It's totally free to use. There's a premium version if you want extra features, but the free tier has everything I need. If you're dealing with Seattle summer camp planning stress, check it out: seacamps.com

### 3. Austin — r/Austin
**Title:** Built a free tool to organize Austin summer camps — tired of the annual registration scramble

Is it just me or does Austin summer camp planning get more chaotic every year? I've got kids at different ages, camps that fill up in February, and a Google Doc that makes me want to cry.

I found mixcamps.com last week and I'm honestly relieved. It's a free summer camp planner that shows week-by-week coverage for your kids. You can browse hundreds of local camps (Austin Parks & Rec, Austin Nature & Science Center, all the private options), filter by what you actually need, and save favorites.

The visual planner is what sold me. You see June, July, August laid out by week, and it highlights which weeks are covered and which ones you're still missing. No more mental math about "wait, does this overlap with that?"

You can also share your calendar with your co-parent, which has already saved us from double-booking. Everything syncs in real time.

It's completely free. There's a paid tier for power users but I haven't needed it. If you're in Austin and dealing with summer camp stress, give it a shot: mixcamps.com

### 4. Denver — r/Denver
**Title:** Free Denver summer camp tool that actually shows weekly coverage — no more spreadsheet hell

I have three kids and every spring I descend into spreadsheet madness trying to plan summer camps. Different age ranges, different schedules, some weeks covered, some weeks total gaps. It's exhausting.

This year I'm using mixcamps.com and it's night and day. It's a free tool built specifically for summer camp planning. You add your kids, browse local camps (Denver Parks & Rec, Cherry Creek, mountain options, all of it), and see week-by-week coverage from June through August.

The planner view is brilliant — you can instantly see which weeks each kid is covered and which ones you still need to fill. You can filter camps by age, price, location, and save the ones that work for your family.

My partner and I can both access the same plan, so we're not sending each other screenshots or trying to coordinate over text. We just look at the calendar and know what's happening.

It's totally free to use. There's an optional premium upgrade but I haven't needed it yet. If you're in Denver and summer camp planning is stressing you out, check it out: mixcamps.com

### 5. San Francisco — r/sanfrancisco, r/AskSF
**Title:** SF summer camp planning tool that's actually free and doesn't make me want to quit parenting

Summer camp planning in the Bay Area is its own special kind of nightmare. Everything fills up instantly, prices are absurd, and I had 60+ tabs open last year trying to compare options.

I found mixcamps.com a few weeks ago and it's saved my sanity. It's a free planner that shows you all your kids' summer weeks in one place and highlights the gaps you still need to fill. You can browse hundreds of SF and Bay Area camps, filter by age and location, and compare prices side by side.

The map view is super helpful for finding camps near home or near work. And the planner view — where you see June, July, August laid out week by week — makes it so obvious which weeks you're covered and which ones are still open.

You can share your plan with your partner too, which has been huge. We're finally on the same page instead of double-booking or missing weeks entirely.

It's completely free. They have a premium tier but I haven't needed it. If you're dealing with SF summer camp stress, give it a try: mixcamps.com

### 6. Boston — r/boston
**Title:** Finally found a free Boston summer camp planner that doesn't require a CS degree to use

I've been planning Boston summer camps for five years now and it never gets easier. Different programs for different ages, some camps only run certain weeks, and I'm always terrified I've missed something important.

This year I'm using mixcamps.com and it's genuinely helpful. It's a free tool that lets you see week-by-week summer coverage for all your kids. You browse camps (Boston Parks & Rec, Cambridge, Brookline, all the usual places), save the ones that fit, and the planner shows you exactly which weeks are covered.

The visual calendar is what makes it work. You see June through August laid out by week, color-coded by kid, and you can instantly spot the gaps. No more mental gymnastics trying to remember if Week 3 conflicts with Week 4.

My husband and I share the same plan now, so we're not sending each other links at midnight trying to coordinate. We just look at the calendar and know what's happening.

It's free to use. There's a premium version but the free tier has been plenty for us. If you're in Boston and summer camp planning stresses you out, check it out: mixcamps.com

### 7. Phoenix — r/phoenix
**Title:** Free Phoenix summer camp planner — actually shows weekly gaps instead of making you guess

Phoenix summer camp planning is brutal. It's hot, everyone needs care, and I was using a color-coded spreadsheet last year that made me feel like I was planning a moon landing.

I found mixcamps.com this year and it's so much better. It's a free summer camp planner that shows you week-by-week coverage from June through August. You can browse local camps, filter by age and price, and see exactly which weeks your kids are covered and which ones still need a plan.

The planner view is the killer feature. You see all your kids' weeks in one place, color-coded, with gaps highlighted. No more scrolling through 12 different camp websites trying to mentally map it all out.

You can also share your plan with your partner or co-parent, which has been a lifesaver. We're both looking at the same calendar instead of trying to coordinate over text.

It's completely free. They offer a premium upgrade but I haven't needed it. If you're in Phoenix and dealing with summer camp stress, give it a shot: mixcamps.com

### 8. Dallas — r/Dallas
**Title:** I built a free Dallas summer camp planner after my spreadsheet nearly ended my marriage

Last year my summer camp planning spreadsheet got so complicated that my husband and I had a 20-minute argument about whether Week 5 overlapped with Week 6. (It didn't. I was just losing my mind.)

This year I'm using mixcamps.com and it's been incredibly helpful. It's a free tool that shows week-by-week summer coverage for your kids. You browse Dallas-area camps, save the ones that work, and the planner highlights which weeks are covered and which ones still need a plan.

The visual calendar makes everything obvious. You see June, July, August laid out by week, and you can instantly spot gaps. You can filter camps by age, price, and location, and compare options side by side.

My husband and I share the same plan now, so we're not texting screenshots back and forth. We just open the calendar and know what's happening. It's saved us so much coordination stress.

It's totally free to use. There's a premium version if you want extra features, but the free tier has everything we need. If you're in Dallas and summer camp planning is making you crazy, check it out: mixcamps.com
