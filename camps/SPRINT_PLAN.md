# FEBRUARY SPRINT: Scale Fast

**Reality check:** SEO takes 3-6 months. We don't have that. We need channels with **immediate reach**.

## Priority Stack (in order)

1. **Paid ads** - Instant traffic, controllable
2. **Community infiltration** - Access to 20K+ parents today
3. **Press/PR** - One article = thousands of visitors
4. **Viral content** - Shareable resources parents need NOW
5. **Partnerships** - Borrow someone else's audience

SEO is background work for next year. Not the focus now.

## IF THINGS AREN'T WORKING

**High CPA on ads (>$10):**
- Test radically different creative
- Narrow targeting (specific neighborhoods, higher income)
- Try video ads
- Pause and focus on free channels

**No PR responses:**
- Follow up (many just miss emails)
- Try different angle: "Local tech" vs "parenting"
- Reach out to specific journalists on Twitter/LinkedIn
- Consider paying for a PR wire release

**Facebook groups not engaging:**
- Content too promotional? Dial back, add more value
- Wrong groups? Find more active ones
- Wrong time? Post morning (7-9am) or evening (7-9pm)

**Low conversion on site:**
- Simplify signup flow
- Add more social proof
- Show value faster (let them search without signup)
- Add urgency ("X camps filling up")
